# Personal Notes

For the sake of speed, I will skip doing the following:

-   Creating a custom favicon.
-   Creating a custom hisogram.
    The imported lib's histogram has a weird display of numbers on the Y axis, so the chart might not look too good.

I won't be use the react router since the task requires only a few components.

If I had more time, I would have made the following improvements:

-   Create a real service RESTful API that handles the input
-   An option to save the current ngram to the database
-   API calls with Axios, Form validation with Formik and YUP
-   Responsive UI design
-   Custom fancy histogram chart
-   Do more Unit tests
